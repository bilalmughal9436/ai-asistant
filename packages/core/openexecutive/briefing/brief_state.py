"""Delivered-brief state: what the last morning/EoD brief covered.

The principal briefs used to re-list the whole unread queue every day and
call the "activity" block "since last brief" when it was really just the
latest N rows. This module gives each recurring brief kind a memory of what
was last *delivered* so the workflow can:

- bound "what changed" to the window since the previous delivery (`since`),
- split proposals into NEW (created inside that window) vs CARRIED OVER,
- list what the Executive's alert review handled inside the window, and
- skip the model call entirely when the fingerprint of the inputs is
  unchanged, sending a one-line "nothing new" instead.

Storage reuses the ``briefing_narrative`` table (``briefing/narrative_cache``)
under a ``brief:<kind>`` scope: ``input_hash`` holds the fingerprint,
``narrative_text`` the delivered artifact and ``generated_at`` the delivery
time. Scopes are only ever read by exact key, so the namespace cannot
collide with the per-viewer header cache. Only the scheduler records a
delivery (after a successful send), so manual workflow runs never advance
the window.
